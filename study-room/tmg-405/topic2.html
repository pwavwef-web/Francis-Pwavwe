    </h2>

    <div class="sr-card">
      <p>
        A <span class="sr-key-term">typology</span> is a system of classification that groups attractions by shared characteristics. Several frameworks have been proposed, and each reveals a different dimension of the attraction universe.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Natural vs Built -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">A. Natural vs. Built (Man-Made) Attractions</p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the most fundamental distinction is between <strong>natural</strong> and <strong>built</strong> attractions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Natural attractions</strong> — features of the physical environment: mountains, waterfalls, beaches, caves, wildlife, national parks. Their appeal often derives from their scenic beauty, biodiversity, or rarity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Built attractions</strong> — created by human activity. These divide into:
          <ul>
            <li><em>Purpose-built</em>: theme parks, zoos, aquaria, heritage centres, casinos</li>
            <li><em>Incidentally attractive</em>: buildings or sites originally constructed for other purposes that now attract visitors — cathedrals, castles, industrial heritage sites</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many attractions combine both dimensions: a wetland bird sanctuary may have a natural core with a purpose-built visitor centre and boardwalk infrastructure.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Swarbrooke's Typology -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">B. Swarbrooke's Four-Category Typology</p>
      <p>
        Swarbrooke (1995) proposed a widely cited classification with four broad categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>Natural attractions:</strong> beaches, cliffs, forests, rivers, lakes, wildlife
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Man-made attractions not originally built to attract tourists:</strong> cathedrals, stately homes, industrial museums, archaeological sites
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Man-made attractions built to attract tourists:</strong> theme parks, heritage centres, purpose-built museums, resorts
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special events:</strong> festivals, sporting events, carnivals, trade fairs — temporary in nature but powerful motivators of travel
        </li>
      </ol>
    </div>

    <!-- Ownership -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">C. Classification by Ownership / Management Sector</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Public sector:</strong> national parks, state museums, government-run historic sites — typically subsidised, with social and educational objectives</li>
        <li><strong>Private sector (commercial):</strong> theme parks, private safari lodges, commercial heritage properties — primarily profit-driven</li>
        <li><strong>Voluntary / Not-for-Profit:</strong> charitable trusts, community heritage groups, religious organisations — motivated by conservation or community benefit</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Access and Scale -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">D. Classification by Visitor Access and Scale</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Free vs. charged entry:</strong> some attractions rely on retail, catering, and donations rather than admission fees</li>
        <li><strong>Regional vs. national vs. international draw:</strong> a local craft market draws regional visitors; an iconic world heritage site attracts an international market</li>
        <li><strong>Permanent vs. temporary:</strong> permanent facilities vs. seasonal, event-based attractions</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Heritage / Theme / Event -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">E. Thematic Classifications</p>
      <p>Some typologies organise attractions by their primary theme or experiential content:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heritage attractions:</strong> historic buildings, battlefields, archaeological sites, living history museums</li>
        <li><strong>Cultural attractions:</strong> art galleries, theatres, ethnic neighbourhoods, craft villages</li>
        <li><strong>Natural/Eco attractions:</strong> national parks, wildlife reserves, botanical gardens</li>
        <li><strong>Leisure and entertainment attractions:</strong> theme parks, casinos, sports stadia, water parks</li>
        <li><strong>Industrial attractions:</strong> factory tours, mine museums, open-air industrial heritage</li>
        <li><strong>Religious / Pilgrimage attractions:</strong> cathedrals, shrines, sacred sites</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="sr-card">
      <div class="sr-highlight-box">
        <strong>Note:</strong> No single typology is definitive. In practice, managers and researchers often use multiple classification dimensions simultaneously — for instance, describing an attraction as <em>natural, internationally significant, free-entry, and conservation-oriented</em>.

      <span class="section-icon">📦</span> 2.2 The Visitor Attraction Product
    </h2>

    <div class="sr-card">
      <p>
        Marketing theory distinguishes between different <em>levels</em> of a product. Applied to visitor attractions, the <span class="sr-key-term">visitor attraction product</span> can be analysed at several layers:
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Core/Actual/Augmented -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">A. Core, Actual, and Augmented Product (Kotler)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Core product:</strong> the fundamental benefit the visitor seeks — entertainment, education, relaxation, spiritual fulfilment, adventure. At its most abstract, visitors buy an <em>experience</em> or <em>memory</em>, not a physical object.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Actual (tangible) product:</strong> the physical components and services that deliver the core benefit — the exhibits, the rides, the guided tour, the site itself.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Augmented product:</strong> additional services and attributes that exceed basic expectations — exceptional customer service, free Wi-Fi, mobile apps, loyalty programmes, accessibility provisions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- Service Characteristics -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">B. Service Characteristics of the Attraction Product</p>
      <p>
        As a service product, the attraction experience has four key characteristics (the IHIP model):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Intangibility:</strong> the experience cannot be inspected or sampled before purchase. Visitors must rely on marketing communications, reviews, and word-of-mouth.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Heterogeneity (variability):</strong> each visitor's experience is unique — shaped by weather, crowd levels, staff quality, and personal mood. Quality management is therefore challenging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Inseparability:</strong> production and consumption occur simultaneously. The visitor must be physically present; the experience is produced and consumed at the same moment.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Perishability:</strong> unsold visitor slots (a queue that never materialised) cannot be stored. Capacity management and demand forecasting are critical.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- The Experience Product -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">C. The Attraction as an Experience Product</p>
      <p>
        Beyond services, modern attraction management increasingly conceptualises the product as a <span class="sr-key-term">designed experience</span>. Pine and Gilmore's (1999) <em>Experience Economy</em> framework (covered in depth in Topic 4) argues that attractions can differentiate themselves by staging memorable, personalised experiences rather than simply delivering services.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shifts the managerial focus from operational efficiency to <strong>experience design</strong> — orchestrating all touchpoints to create emotional resonance, authenticity, and narrative coherence.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- Product Life Cycle -->
    <div class="sr-card">
      <p class="sr-card-title">D. The Attraction Product Life Cycle</p>
      <p>
        Like any product, visitor attractions follow a <span class="sr-key-term">product life cycle</span> — introduction, growth, maturity, and decline (though some reach a stable plateau rather than declining). Management implications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Introduction:</em> heavy marketing spend, visitor numbers building, operating at a loss</li>
        <li><em>Growth:</em> rapid increase in visitors, revenue rises, competitors may enter</li>
        <li><em>Maturity:</em> visitor numbers stable but competitive pressure increases; management must innovate to sustain appeal</li>
        <li><em>Decline:</em> falling visitor numbers; options include refurbishment/reinvention, repositioning, or closure</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="sr-highlight-box">
        <strong>Butler's TALC (Tourism Area Life Cycle, 1980)</strong> applies a similar framework at the destination level — exploration, involvement, development, consolidation, stagnation, followed by possible rejuvenation or decline.
