## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Firebase not initialized"
**Solution**: Ensure you have an internet connection and Firebase configuration is correct.

### Issue: "Unable to sign in"
**Solution**: 
- Verify pwavwef@gmail.com account exists in Firebase Authentication
- Check password is correct
- Ensure Email/Password authentication is enabled in Firebase Console

### Issue: "No messages appearing"
**Solution**:
- Check Firestore database has a `messages` collection
- Verify security rules allow reads for authenticated admin
- Test submitting a message through the website contact form

### Issue: "AI Assistant not responding"
**Solution**:
- Verify Gemini API key is valid
- Check internet connection
- Ensure you haven't exceeded API rate limits
- Check browser console for errors

### Issue: "CORS errors in console"
**Solution**: 
- Don't open the HTML file directly (file://)
- Use a local web server (see "Local Testing" above)
- For production, deploy to GitHub Pages or similar hosting

## Security Considerations

1. **API Keys**: The Firebase and Gemini API keys are included in the HTML file (client-side). This is normal for Firebase web apps, but ensure:
   - Firebase API key is restricted in Google Cloud Console
   - Firestore security rules are properly configured
   - Only authorized domains can access the Firebase project

2. **Authentication**: 
   - Only pwavwef@gmail.com can access the panel
   - Firebase handles secure password authentication
   - Sessions expire automatically

3. **Data Access**:
   - All database operations require authentication
   - Firestore rules prevent unauthorized access
   - Messages can only be viewed/deleted by the authenticated admin

## Support

For issues or questions:
- Email: pwavwef@gmail.com
- Check Firebase Console for backend issues
- Review browser console for client-side errors
